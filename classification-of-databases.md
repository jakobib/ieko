## A faceted classification of databases

Individual databases and database types can be grouped and described according
to multiple criteria.  From the perspective of Knowledge Organization databases
in general can best be classified in four semantic categories:


* **Domain of Application**

  The most practical aspect of a database is its intended or its actual use.
  This domain of a database can be 

    * a **subject area** (e.g. chemical databases, biological databases, 
      financial databases, bibliographical databases, music database...),

    * an **audience or operator** (e.g. public databases, private databases,
      government databases, decision support systems, collaborative databases...), 

    * a **type of access** (e.g. online databases, free databases,
      commercial databases...)

  among other categories.


* **Content Type**

  This aspect refers to the type of records or documents stored in a database.
  Content types are defined by a common data model or data format that all
  individual records must conform to (see section XXX). Typical database types
  by content type include:

    * **knowledge bases** store factual statements.

    * **document repositories** store
      [documents](http://www.isko.org/cyclo/document)
      such as texts or media files.

    * **spatial database** store geographical information.

    * **terminology databases** store units of language and concepts.

  Content types mainly dictate how data from databases can be used and combined
  in other information systems, independently from technical and organizational
  aspects (see [interoperability](http://www.isko.org/cyclo/interoperability)).

  
* **Database Model**

  The database model of a database is a fundamental paradigm that influences
  how data can best be organized in a database. That is why this aspect of
  databases is mostly referred to as *database type*. Popular database models
  include relational databases, object database, graph database,
  document-oriented database, flat-file database, and data warehouses.

  Basic properties of distinct database models are described in section XXX.


* **Implementation**

  Technical aspects of databases are more relevant in computer science than
  in Knowledge Organization. Nevertheless types of implementation influence
  how databases can be used, so implementations play an important role for
  instance for usability.

  Examples of categories in this facet of database classification include
  distributed databases, in-memory databases, and blockchains.
