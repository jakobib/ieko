# Introduction

The term **database** is used with at least five intertwingled connotations:

* A **data set** is an organized collection of data. This is also known as
  *content* of a database. For instance, the content of a bibliographic
  database is a set of bibliographic records. On the other hand a set of
  records already establishes a database by its own structure. In this
  sense each database is a also [document](http://www.isko.org/cyclo/document).

* A **data model** is a formal conceptualization realized in the way a
  collection of data is organized. Data models are typically described
  in levels of abstraction from conceptual models to data schemas, formats,
  and structures. All models at least implicitly assume a connection 
  of their components to ontological entities. For instance, database fields
  such as "author" and "date" correspond to notions of authorship and time.
  In this sense each database is also a
  [knowledge organization system](http://www.isko.org/cyclo/kos).

* A **database management system** is a computer program to facilitate and
  control the creation and modification of structured sets of data. This
  includes the definition of data models, the collection of data conforming to
  these data models and access to the data in secure and performant manner.

* A **database service** or database application is an information system that
  provides services around a managed set of data, for instance a library
  catalog, a preprint service, or a web search engine . Database services
  support more specific use cases than database management system. Their notion
  of a database goes beyond the realm of data by inclusion of non-technical
  aspects such as hosting institutions, workflows, and usability.

These aspects of databases are covered in sections on [data modeling](#data-modeling)
including basic properties of data and data sets, [database management systems](#dbms),
and [database services](#services). The [history of databases](#history) first provides
phenomenological background and insights about the nature of databases. 
A [faceted classifion of databases](#classification) finally helps to locate individual
databases and database types from the perspective of Knowledge Organization.
