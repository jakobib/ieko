# Database management systems

This section will briefly describe database management systems (DBMS) and
database models. Important database models include:

* relational databases (relational model)
* object database (object-oriented model)
* graph database
* document-oriented database
* flat-file databases
* data warehouses (star or snowflake schema)

Outdated models, except for very specialized applications, include network
databases (CODASYL) and hierarchical databases (except for file system).

NoSQL broadly refers to all non-relation models. Special kinds of NoSQL
databases for a specialized data types include key-value stores, XML databases,
geospatial databases, and triple stores. The latter often include inference
rules (deductive database). Another special feature found in some DBMS is
versioning (temporal databases).

Other specialized models such as column-oriented databases mostly differ by
implementation to increase performance for their applications. 

Hierarchical file systems and tabular spreadsheets are often used as databases
despite or because of their simplicity. 

Form the perspective of knowledge organization technical aspects are less
important.

In practice data is also shaped by other aspects of DBMS than its database models:
usability, scripting, APIs, popularity... (example: FileMaker).
